Project description:
--------------------

The Gemini Naming project implements support for using the Java Naming and Directory Interface™ (also known as JNDI™) within an OSGi environment. This project provides the following: a standard mechanism for publishing and locating JNDI™ Service Provider implementations within an OSGi framework, support for the existing traditional model of JNDI™ clients, a new service-based model for interacting with JNDI™ providers, and the ability to access OSGi services using osgi-based URL lookups.
